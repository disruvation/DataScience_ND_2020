# Data Science Nanodegree 2020

This repository contains my solutions for the projects I created during the Udacity Nanodegree course: Data Science. <br>
I participated in the course between Q3/2020 and Q4/2020.<br>

Projects: <br>

2. Write A Data Science Blog Post <br>
In this project I analyzed Boston Airbnb data using the CRISP-DM Process and wrote a blog post about my work. 

3. - <br>
Lesson 3 does not have a project. Nevertheless it involves smaller notebooks and tasks about general software engineering. 

4. Disaster Response Pipelines <br>
Analyzing disaster messages using a machine learning model via a web app. 

5. Recommendations with IBM <br>
In this project, I used my recommendation skills to use on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. This includes exploratory data analysis, rank based recommendations, user-user based collaborative filtering and matrix factorization to use singular value decomposition (SVD) for recommendations. 

6. Starbucks Capstone <br>
The last project is about optimizing app offers with Starbucks.
